# Shrinkage_Methods
A study comparing different shrinkage methods. The study showed that methods such as LASSO, Ridge and Elastic Net differ in performance with differing data generating process. 
We also observed the weight distribution process in Elastic Net, it was found that Elastic Net provides provides more weights to better performing methods most of the time.
